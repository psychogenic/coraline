Coraline
========
Ionic/Cordova/web-tech powered Linux apps and plugin system

Coraline allows you to run ionic, cordova and other web tech apps natively on Linux desktops.  It aims to replace the now-defunct cordova-ubuntu and allow give all Linux users access to web tech apps.

The [Coraline Project Site](https://coraline.psychogenic.com/) has more info, but the gist of it is that Coraline can run any cordova/ionic app (that limits itself to using the available plugins, a list that is currently small but growing).

Simply launch coraline to see the built-in demo app, or point it to an HTML file.
